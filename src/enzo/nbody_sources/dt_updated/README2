1. the things I have changed in this code

? removed input file and put the relevant parameters in the code
? removed unnecessary output files

in this code, I will finally put out only the files that I need... don't worry!

2. the things I will change after compiling this

- check escaping conditions and remove that
- check for external force options and remove that
- remove unnecessary files (like stellar evolution) from code

3. from bottom up mode, I would have to check with intgrt.f.... as usuall.....



4. notes when editing this code
