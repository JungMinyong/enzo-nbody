for reading, I need to check

1. instar.F -> only called when stellar evolution is on (KZ19>2), so don't need to worry about input in this case!
2. modify.F -> called when restarting (or when KSTART>2), so no need to worry!
3. ttinit.f -> code for tidal tensors. not needed right now! used in modify.F and start.F



for output, I need to re-check

1. mydump.f
used in chterm, nbody, adjust, intgrt, ttcal... etc
subroutine for common save or reading

2. file_init.f
subroutine for opening files

what it does: (code structure)

- set JFMIN = 1, JFMAX = 9
- write FRAG(JF)+JF (file name format, ex: fort, conf etc) to FILE from jfmin to jfmax
(istart = 0: 1~9, istart = 1 : 2, istart = 3: 2
- write other important file names to FILE() list (ex: dat.10)
- write appropriate file name depending on isize (isize: needed for writing format)
all the if statements are for writing down proper file names... depending on integer size written to file name
- open all files with appropriate units!

probably isize: interger size and rank = the number of steps..?
new file is written every time file_init is called with a new rank!!
and the files are opened once again



3. output.f
